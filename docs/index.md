## sosecrets

`sosecrets` is a Python module that provides a secure way to handle sensitive data by encapsulating it and only exposing it through a controlled interface. It is designed to be used in scenarios where sensitive data needs to be securely handled and kept confidential.

This module provides a `Secret` class that encapsulates a secret value and only exposes it through a controlled interface. It also provides a number of related classes and exceptions to support this functionality.

### Why use `sosecrets`

Here are some reasons to use sosecrets in your Python projects:

* Secure secrets management: Sosecrets ensures that secrets are stored securely and not exposed to the outside world. It uses encapsulation to hide the secret value from the rest of your code, and provides a controlled interface for accessing the value.

* Encapsulation of secret values: With sosecrets, you can encapsulate secret values in a way that prevents accidental exposure. This means that even if a developer accidentally logs or returns the secret value, it will not be visible to an attacker.

* Controlled access to secrets: With sosecrets, you can control access to secret values by defining a method that exposes the secret value only to authorized code. This ensures that secrets are not accidentally exposed to unauthorized code.

* Easy to use: Sosecrets is easy to use and integrates well with your existing Python code. It uses Python's built-in type annotations to define secret values, making it easy to understand and use.

* Flexible: Sosecrets is flexible and can be used in a variety of scenarios. It can be used to manage secrets in web applications, command-line tools, or any other Python project that requires secure management of secrets.

* Prevents inheritance: Sosecrets prevents inheritance of its Secret class, ensuring that secrets cannot be accidentally exposed by a subclass. This helps to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensures that secrets are properly managed.

* Built-in exceptions: Sosecrets provides built-in exceptions that can be used to handle common errors when working with secrets. This can help to reduce coding errors and improve the overall security of your code.

* Testable: Sosecrets is testable and integrates well with Python testing frameworks. You can easily write tests to ensure that your secrets are properly managed and not accidentally exposed.

* Open source: Sosecrets is an open-source library, meaning that the code is available for inspection and can be audited for security vulnerabilities. This provides an extra layer of security and ensures that the library is trustworthy.

Overall, sosecrets is a powerful tool for managing secrets in your Python projects. It provides a secure and easy-to-use way to manage secrets, ensuring that they are not accidentally exposed and that your code is more secure. If you're working with secrets in your Python projects, sosecrets is definitely worth considering.
